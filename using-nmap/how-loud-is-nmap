Nmap is a great tool for getting more information about hosts and networks. Depending on how it is used, nmap can be very loud! I will do 
a couple of different scans to see how much traffic they generate in the NSM.
For these scans I am using a standalone Security Onion (SO) installation with default settings with two other hosts connected in a virtual network.

1. First I will scan and discover various machines on the network by entering the command "nmap 192.168.1.0/24" in the terminal. Nmap can find
three hosts: 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.5, and 192.168.1.15. With default settings, Security Onion triggered a total of 14 alerts, all of which
are labeled as medium priority. The more machines and hosts that are on a network, the more alerts will be generated as each will be scanned.

2. Next I will scan one of the hosts with a simple "nmap 192.168.1.15" command to see which ports are open on this specific host.This scan 
triggers 7 alerts in SO, and they are a mix of low and medium priority. This scan won't search every port on the host. A more specific command
such as "nmap 192.168.1.15 -p 0-10000" would scan ports 0-10000 and generate more alerts.

3. I still want some more information on the other host, so I will perform an aggressive scan with "sudo nmap -A 192.168.1.5". This scan is by far much louder
and more noticeable than the preceding attempts. This scan generates high priority alerts instead of medium, and there are many more of them! This method generated
a total of 79 alerts, while the previous scans averaged about 10. However, we are able to get much more information about the host, including subject alternative name,
device type, and the OS and version as well as open ports.Performing an aggressive scan is higher risk and higher reward. It attracts much more attention but is also able
to pull a lot more information.

Of note is that every alert generated in all of the tests identifies the source IP. Extensive use of nmap is sure not to go unnoticed!
