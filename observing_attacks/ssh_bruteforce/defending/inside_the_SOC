1., 2. After taking a several hour long lunch break, we return to see that our Security Onion monitoring has been flooding alerts. 
SO alerts us that someone is trying to log in to a remote shell using SSH to our host 192.168.1.2. Not good! We will start up Wireshark and 
take a look at the activity. We are quickly flooded with communications between our host 192.168.1.2 and our unknown attacker 192.168.1.5.
How did they get on our network and get a local IP in the first place?

4. Even worse, we can see that someone has made a successful login after multiple failed attempts!

5. Through wireshark, we can also see that the attacker made a connection and executed some unknown commands on our server before disconnecting.

Looking through the logs on our host 192.168.1.2, we see that the successful login was made using the login credentials service:service. We should
remove this default account and change the passwords on all other active accounts. If we see any other unused default accounts or accounts with default
passwords, we should change those immediately as well. The attacker could have exfiltrated our /shadow file and may be brute forcing more passwords.
We could optionally start using ssh keys to log in instead of passwords. While we are looking at our controls, we should close other ports we are not using,
like http on port 80. We can restrict the amount of SSH log in attempts as well. Finally, we should investigate how the attacker was able to access our network.
We should ensure NAC is active on all ethernet ports and that our wifi uses strong passwords and has weak encryptions like WEP disabled.
