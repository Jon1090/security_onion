1. After connecting to an insecure network, I try and find other hosts using a simple nmap scan ("nmap 
192.168.1.0/24"). I find a potential host with open ports including ssh at 192.168.1.2.

2. Next, I perform a more direct scan of 192.168.1.2 using nmap with "sudo nmap -sV -O -sC -p22 192.168.1.2".
I use these switches to try and find the version and operating system of the host. The -sC is for default script,
I can use a more aggressive method next if I don't find the results I am looking for. I discover this
host is using OpenSSH 7.4 (protocol 2.0) and is running Linux.

3. I try a basic brute force attack with "sudo nmap -sV -O --script=ssh* -p22 192.168.1.2" but glean no new information.
My next step is to use metasploit to try and find possible usernames. Unfortunately, this server is hardened and returns
false positive results, so this approach will not work either.

4. For now, my only other option is a slow and bruteforce approach. For this attack I use hydra. I can specify a username
file with the -L switch and a password file with -P. I start  the process and return in a few hours to see that patience has
paid off. Hydra returns a login of service:service. With these credentials, I am able to start a remote SSH login and
access the host system.
